# HA-Growing Tree-CNN
The objective of this work is to improve the Tree-CNN approach and this will be done by the HA-Growing algorithm (Human Adaptive-Growing), that enhances the growing process and integrates the data-driven approach with human knowledge, allowing user interaction during the training process. A detailed description of what the code does and an analysis of the results can be found in the Report file.

## How it works
You can run the code with a Python environment (like Spyder) or directly from the terminal (inside the root folder of the project) like this: 
```
> python /src/main.py
```

## Dataset
You can download the dataset from that folder: **https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qcCSvO8Ll1OVq0BgWatpqE_ip_lz64z0?usp=sharing**
